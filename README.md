# Desafio | Frontend Developer

During the challenge I tried to think in the development of the *Landing Page* not only as a single page, but rather as something that could grow and would consequently make maintenance more complicated; in this sense I created the header and footer layout separately (later added them to the *index.html* using JavaScript) and both the script and stylesheet were created in separate files. All the *JavaScript* programming and *CSS* style was performed without the use of any additional library, such as Jquery or Bootstrap, something that made development a little slower and where I could see how much such libraries and frameworks simplify the creation of a WEB application. I also worried about adding some simple CSS effects on the page, as I believe they give a refinement to the user experience. During the programming, I had one question (which led me to another), if you can answer me, I appreciate it:
- I was bothered by inserting the product card in *index.html* as I did in the *updateCard* function mixing javascript with HTML (something I believe if the application grew up, would make maintenance a little tricky to do), there is any way to make it better?
- In the same sense, something that makes me question my previous issue is that I recently started learning React, and in that case, using this library, I would not do what I mentioned earlier, by mixing JavaScript with JSX elements and consequently making the management of the code a little more complicated?
